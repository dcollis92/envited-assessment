# Envited React Tech Assessment

### This project utilized [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/).

## Accomplishments

While the project didn't have a backend to feed information, I still wanted to construct a Frontend that was properly connected to a potential Backend. With this in mind, I have the following stubbed up:

#### `services`

- `authService`: providing login/logout functionality while crosschecking the provided Authorization
- `profileService`: provide user information for when the user interacts with other profiles
- `tokenService`: utilizing JWT functionality for providing the user with an AuthToken
- `events`: Featuring all CRUD functionality when interacting with a backend (modeled after PostgreSQL)

#### `Forms`

- `EventForm`: to import and set the formData from SQL (title, date, etc.)
- `EventInput`: Input functionality for populating these data fields

#### `EventDeleteConfirmation`

- While only edit/update functionality was requested, I thought it would field empty to not include the final step in the CRUD functionality

## Shortcomings

I found myself sensing I would run out of time (as one often feels under the pressure of a timed assessment), but I wanted to tackle this assignment with gratitude for the opportunity to practice my React skills. With additional time, I feel confident that I would've been able to fully complete this assignment plus all of my Icebox implementations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
